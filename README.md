Brownian Motion (pedesis) describes the random movement of small particles suspended in a liquid or a gas due to their collisions with other molecules or atoms.

## Fractional Brownian Motion
Fractional Brownian Motion is a generalization of Brownian Motion. It's a Gaussian random function that is described by the following covariance function:

Where _H Ïµ (0,1)_ is the Hurst parameter.
For _H = 1/2_ the Fractional Brownian Motion is a Brownian Motion.
